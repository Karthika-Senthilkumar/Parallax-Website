            <h1>MY DREAM DESTINATIONS</h1>
            <h2 class="H1">Dubai</h2>
        </div>
        <section id="S1">
        <p>Dubai is one of the most beautiful areas on earth where everything the mind can imagine. I watch many documentaries about 
        amazing modern constructions that break all records. Also, in many films, I can watch some of the shots that were filmed in 
        Dubai. Such shots make me very excited to visit Dubai and enjoy its beautiful scenery. Dubai has emerged as one of the finest 
        places to visit with ample of attractions from heritage sites, exclusive resorts and hotels overlooking the beach to famous 
        landmarks like Burj Al Arab, newly constructed Burj khalifa, the palm, the world, etc. I definitely made a list of the areas 
        that I like to go to when I visit Dubai. Such as Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Dubai theme park, Dubai Opera, Dubai Aquarium. Many 
        of these wonderful places that I know everything about, I only need to visit and see their views on nature. I am very curious 
        to know if the information I have gathered about Dubai is similar to what I imagined in my mind, or better or less. That feeling
        of longing makes me more interested in visiting it.</p>

            <h2 class="H2">Paris</h2>
        </div>
        <section id="S2">
        <p>Paris is one of my dream places because of all the exciting things found there. One of the exciting things I would like 
        to do is to go sightseeing all around the city. The next thing I would like to do is visit the eiffel tower. Lastly, I would 
        like to experience a new culture and try new foods while I'm there. The Eiffel Tower is one of the three tallest structures in 
        the world, so I would love to see the scenery from the top of the building. Another reason I want to see the tower is to see if 
        the fact that it shrinks 6 inches in the cold weather is true. Lastly, I want to visit the tower to add onto the 250 million 
        people that have already visited.</p>

            <h2 class="H3">Switzerland</h2>
        </div>
        <section id="S3">
        <p>I have traveled to some of the most beautiful places in India, but my dream of having a holiday with my family to 
        Switzerland still remains my biggest dream. As Switzerland is one of the most attractive vacation destinations today in the
        world because of its lakes, beautiful mountain ranges, snowfall and many interesting places that make it a perfect tourist 
        attraction. It may come as a surprise to many that how a small country like Switzerland is one of the biggest tourist 
        attraction on the earth. Located on the continent of Europe. Although known for its unique and economic banking system, its 
        is more famous for its numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps. The capital of Switzerland is Zurich. The 
        country is uniquely known for its Ski resorts and hiking trail so hikers have no cause for alarm. In fact, it is regarded 
        as one of the biggest cities in the world because of its modern outlook, quite busy and business oriented. Its cities 
        contain medieval quarter with landmarks such as capital Bern's zytyglogge clock tower and Lucerne's wooden chapel bridge.</p>

            <h2 class="H4">Canada</h2>
        </div>
        <section id="S4">
        <p>The expanse of Canada's natural beauty, from mountains and glaciers to secluded lakes and forests, is almost unparalleled 
        worldwide. But Canada's allure is not just the great outdoors. Canada has cosmopolitan cities that are clean, safe, friendly, 
        and multicultural. In fact, Canada repeatedly is lauded as one of the world's most livable countries. Whether your interests 
        are river rafting or live theater, Canada won't disappoint. Canada is a famous "northern" destination, but it's not all igloos 
        and snowcaps. Spring, summer, and fall have their own charms and add to Canada's appeal. Of course, because Canada is so large, 
        the climate varies greatly, allowing for a wide range of activities year-round. </p>
